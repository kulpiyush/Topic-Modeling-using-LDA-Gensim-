        "As the number of people infected with the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is continuously increasing every day, development of potential therapeutic platforms is vital. Based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, it seems crucial to assay the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with SARS-CoV2 spike (S)-protein. Indeed, developing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope-specific vaccines (ESV). Herein, we present an overview on the discovery of new CoV followed by some explanation on the SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD site. Furthermore, we surveyed the novel therapeutic mAbs for targeting S-protein RBD such as S230, 80R, F26G18, F26G19, CR3014, CR3022, M396, and S230.15. Afterwards, the mechanism of interaction of RBD and different mAbs were explained and it was suggested that one of the SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs, namely CR3022, could show the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for rapid and sensitive advancement of therapeutic mAbs targeting S-protein RBD were discussed. In conclusion, it may be proposed that this review may pave the way for recognition of RBD and different mAbs to develop potential therapeutic ESV.\n",

        "The lungs are the most commonly affected organ by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the kidneys are also frequently affected. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can not only cause new kidney damage but also increase the difficulty of treatment and care as well as mortality for people with underlying kidney diseases. Kidney involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly manifests as kidney tubular injury. Proteinuria is the main clinical sign. To reduce patient mortality, kidney complications should be given increased attention in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study reviews the existing literature and discusses COVID-19 infection in combination with kidney diseases in terms of kidney damage, pathogenesis, and treatment to guide clinical anti-epidemic responses.\n",

        "The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has provoked a second pandemic, the \"long-haulers\", i.e., individuals presenting with post-COVID symptoms. We propose that to determine the presence of post-COVID symptoms, symptoms should appear after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, this situation has some problems due to the fact that not all people infected by SARS-CoV-2 receive such diagnosis. Based on relapsing/remitting nature of post-COVID symptoms, the following integrative classification is proposed: potentially infection related-symptoms (up to 4-5 weeks), acute post-COVID symptoms (from week 5 to week 12), long post-COVID symptoms (from week 12 to week 24), and persistent post-COVID symptoms (lasting more than 24 weeks). The most important topic is to establish the time reference points. The classification also integrates predisposing intrinsic and extrinsic factors and hospitalization data which could promote post-COVID symptoms. The plethora of symptoms affecting multiple systems exhibited by \"long-haulers\" suggests the presence of different underlying mechanisms.Background: Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carry differential risks to public health. The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, first identified in Botswana on November 11, 2021, has spread globally faster than any previous variant of concern. Understanding the transmissibility of Omicron is vital in the development of public health policy.\n",
        "Objective: The aim of this study is to compare SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks driven by Omicron to those driven by prior variants of concern in terms of both the speed and magnitude of an outbreak.\n",
        "Methods: We analyzed trends in outbreaks by variant of concern with validated surveillance metrics in several southern African countries. The region offers an ideal setting for a natural experiment given that most outbreaks thus far have been driven primarily by a single variant at a time. With a daily longitudinal data set of new infections, total vaccinations, and cumulative infections in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated how the emergence of Omicron has altered the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We used the Arellano-Bond method to estimate regression coefficients from a dynamic panel model, in which new infections are a function of infections yesterday and last week. We controlled for vaccinations and prior infections in the population. To test whether Omicron has changed the average trajectory of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we included an interaction between an indicator variable for the emergence of Omicron and lagged infections.\n",
        "Results: The observed Omicron outbreaks in this study reach the outbreak threshold within 5-10 days after first detection, whereas other variants of concern have taken at least 14 days and up to as many as 35 days. The Omicron outbreaks also reach peak rates of new cases that are roughly 1.5-2 times those of prior variants of concern. Dynamic panel regression estimates confirm Omicron has created a statistically significant shift in viral spread.\n",
        "Conclusions: The transmissibility of Omicron is markedly higher than prior variants of concern. At the population level, the Omicron outbreaks occurred more quickly and with larger magnitude, despite substantial increases in vaccinations and prior infections, which should have otherwise reduced susceptibility to new infections. Unless public health policies are substantially altered, Omicron outbreaks in other countries are likely to occur with little warning.The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is leading to unknown and unusual health conditions that are challenging to manage. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is one of those challenges, having become increasingly common as the pandemic evolves. The latest estimates suggest that 10 to 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 patients who undergo an acute symptomatic phase are experiencing effects of the disease beyond 12 weeks after diagnosis. Although research is beginning to examine this new condition, there are still serious concerns about the diagnostic identification, which limits the best therapeutic approach. Exercise programs and physical activity levels are well-known modulators of the clinical manifestations and prognosis in many chronic diseases. This narrative review summarizes the up-to-date evidence on post-COVID-19 syndrome to contribute to a better knowledge of the disease and explains how regular exercise may improve many of these symptoms and could reduce the long-term effects of COVID-19.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has spread worldwide since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking. Herein, we briefly explain why most COVID-19 vaccines target the S protein, update the progress of research regarding S protein-related COVID-19 vaccines, review the latest studies concerning the effects of S protein variants on COVID-19 vaccines, and finally, propose certain strategies to deal with SARS-CoV-2 variants.As the latest identified novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC), the influence of Omicron on our globe grows promptly. Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron. Considering these crucial mutations and their implications including an increase in transmissibility, COVID-19 severity, and reduction of efficacy of currently available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, Omicron has been classified as one of the VOC. Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research. Collectively, our data suggest that due to continuous variation in the spike glycoprotein sequences, the use of coronavirus-specific attachment inhibitors may not be the current choice of therapy for emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Hence, we need to proceed with a sense of urgency in this matter.\n",

        "Recently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, after recovery has increased; this has caused a dilemma regarding the medical measures and policies. We evaluated the dynamics of viral load and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in four patients with positive RT-PCR results after recovery. In all patients, the highest levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies were reached after about a month of the onset of the initial symptoms. Then, the IgG titers plateaued, and the IgM titers decreased, regardless of RT-PCR results. The IgG and IgM levels did not increase after the post-negative positive RT-PCR results in any of the patients. Our results reinforced that the post-negative positive RT-PCR results may be due to the detection of RNA particles rather than reinfection in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.\n",

        "At the stroke of the New Year 2020, COVID-19, a zoonotic disease that would turn into a global pandemic, was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Although unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS. In this article, we first provided an overview of COVID-19 etiology vis-à-vis other zoonotic diseases, particularly SARS and MERS. Then, we summarized the characteristics of droplets/aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and how they aid in the transmission of the virus among people. Moreover, we discussed the molecular mechanisms that enable SARS-CoV-2 to access the host and become more contagious than other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. Further, we outlined various approaches that are currently being employed to diagnose and symptomatically treat COVID-19 in the clinic. Finally, we reviewed various approaches and technologies employed to develop vaccines against COVID-19 and summarized the attempts to repurpose various classes of drugs and novel therapeutic approaches.﻿Objective: The frequency of vaccine refusal, which is associated with many factors, is increasing worldwide.

        "Methods: A survey consisting of 16 questions about COVID-19 vaccination was conducted either face-to-face or online with 428 parents who agreed to participate in the study. The parents had children who were inpatients or outpatients in the Children's Hospital of Ankara City Hospital. In the survey, parents were asked about family sociodemographic characteristics, opinions on domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines, and reasons for vaccine refusal.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Results: While 66.1% of parents were reluctant to receive foreign COVID-19 vaccines, only 37.4% were reluctant to receive domestic COVID-19 vaccines. The participants' preference for the domestic vaccine was significantly higher for themselves and their children (P < 0.05). Women were less likely to be willing to receive foreign vaccines than men (P < 0.05). As the education level increased, fewer parents preferred the domestic vaccine for themselves (P = 0.046) and their children (P = 0.005). Both domestic and foreign vaccine acceptability for parents and their children was higher among parents with high anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 infection (P < 0.05). The most common reasons for refusal were anxiety about vaccine side effects, lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of vaccines, and distrust of vaccines originating from abroad.\n",

The majority of patients will experience mild disease, but others will develop a severe respiratory infection that requires hospitalisation. This is causing a significant strain on health services. Patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever with varying severity. The appropriate triaging of patients will assist in preventing health services becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. This is assisted through clinical assessment and various imaging and laboratory investigations, including chest X-ray, blood analysis and identification of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, a succinct triaging pathway that aims to be fast, reliable and affordable is presented. The hope is that such a pathway will assist health services in appropriately combating the pandemic.\n",

        "Coronavirus has emerged as a global health threat due to its accelerated geographic spread over the last two decades. This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment. Development of a vaccine to eliminate the virus from the host still remains an ongoing challenge.﻿Purpose: Although patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have several risk factors for ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), the reported incidence of hospital-acquired infections is low. We aimed to determine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, and the incidence of VA-LRTI.\n",

VA-LRTI, including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. All VA-LRTI were prospectively identified, and chest-X rays were analyzed by at least two physicians.

        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic since it emerged in December 2019. Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%). Our results suggested that the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovered patients may have a robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half rises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of the humoral immune response in the period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing a vaccine.\n",

        "In-hospital transmission is one of the main routes of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spreading among health care workers (HCWs) who are the frontline fighters. However, coming into contact with COVID-19-positive patients is unavoidable. Therefore, hand hygiene is of utmost importance for the prevention of COVID-19 among HCWs. This purpose can be achieved by applying alcohol-based hand rubs, washing hands properly with soap and water, and applying other antiseptic agents. Nevertheless, regular hand hygiene could also be challenging, because water, detergents, and disinfectants may predispose HCWs to hand dermatitis. The current article reviews the risk factors for the development of hand dermatitis, with further focus on the most common agents used among HCWs. In addition, the risk of occupational hand dermatitis for each agent is evaluated to increase awareness of this common condition. Finally, some recommendations are discussed to reduce the effect of hand dermatitis on HCWs.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Overall COVID-19-related rates of mortality are low; deaths usually occur in patients older than 60 and those suffering from serious chronic diseases. Most of the patients recover within one or two weeks. However, in approximately 5-10 % of the patients some of the symptoms persist for weeks and months. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a multisystem disease with overlapping symptoms and may occur even in patients who were relatively mildly affected during the acute phase of the disease. Evaluating the number of patients with or after the novel coronavirus infection in the Czech Republic, it can be estimated that in the next months there will be about 50,000 new patients suffering from long-COVID-19 requiring attention of general practitioners in the least, and, in all probability, also of other medical specialists. A thorough knowledge of the syndrome and efficient ideally evidence-based guidelines have to be formulated to combat the adverse impact of the pandemic.﻿Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection of the zygomycete family that can cause various types of infections. In most cases, there exist underlying conditions that predispose the hosts to the infection. As the fungi responsible are typical environmental organisms, they are usually non-pathologic in immunocompetent individuals. In immunosuppressed patients, however, these otherwise innocuous organisms can become a devastating and difficult-to-treat opportunistic infection. There are several clinical forms of infection: pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, encephalic, and rhinocerebral. The latter must be differentiated from allergic fungal sinusitis, which is a non-invasive, local overgrowth in immunocompetent patients. Mucormycosis is characterized by tissue necrosis due to an invasion of blood vessels and subsequent thrombosis, which usually follows a rapid progression. The key to treatment is early and aggressive surgical debridement, along with high doses of intravenous antifungal therapy.﻿Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the current global pandemic, COVID-19.

        "Keywords: COVID-19; Coronavirus; Disinfection; Hand sanitizer; Quaternary ammonium; SARS-CoV-2.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as an international emergency in 2020. Its prevalence and fatality rate are rapidly increasing but the medication options are still limited for this perilous disease. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps propagating globally. The present scenario has emphasized the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this latest pandemic. Despite the fact, the deteriorating developments of COVID-19, there is no drug certified to have considerable effects in the medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 pandemic requests for the rapid testing of new treatment approaches. Based on the evidence, hydroxychloroquine is the first medicine opted for the treatment of disease. Umifenovir, remdesivir, and fevipiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agent by improving the health of infected patients. The dexamethasone is a first known steroid medicine that can save the lives of seriously ill patients, and it is shown in a randomized clinical trial by the United Kingdom that it reduced the death rate in COVID-19 patients. The current review recapitulates the existing evidence of possible therapeutic drugs, peptides, humanized antibodies, convulsant plasma, and vaccination that has revealed potential in fighting COVID-19 infections. Many randomized and controlled clinical trials are taking place to further validate these agent's safety and effectiveness in curing COVID-19.The need to curb the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the community and to diagnose those at risk of developing complications implies that an appropriate test should be chosen according to the epidemiological and clinical context. Rapid antigen tests, either nasopharyngeal or nasal, have the advantage of reflecting contagiousness better than PCR and giving an immediate result, reason why they are used as first-line for community diagnosis and screening. A rapid test allows immediate management of outpatients and does not falsely attribute the current acute episode to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. PCR, whether nasopharyngeal or buccosalivary, is useful for epidemiological surveillance, including that of new variants, as well as identification of severe COVID in the post-infectious phase.The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which is responsible for COVID-19 disease, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. The virus rapidly spread, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic by March 2020. With millions of confirmed cases worldwide, there is growing concern and considerable debate regarding the potential for coronavirus infection to contribute to an appreciable burden of chronic respiratory symptoms or fibrotic disease among recovered individuals. Because the first case of COVID-19 was documented less than one year ago, data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are not yet available, and predictions for long-term outcome are speculative at best. However, due to the staggering number of cases and the severity of disease in many individuals, there is a critical need to consider the potential long-term implications of COVID-19. This review examines current basic and clinical data regarding fibrogenic mechanisms of viral injury in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Several intersecting mechanisms between coronavirus infection and fibrotic pathways are discussed to highlight factors and processes that may be targetable to improve patient outcome. Reports of post-infection sequelae from previous coronavirus outbreaks are presented toward the goal of improved recognition of potential contributing risk factors for fibrotic disease.\n",

Scientific communities around the world have been rigorously working to develop a potent vaccine to combat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), employing conventional and novel vaccine strategies. Gene-based vaccine platforms based on viral vectors, DNA, and RNA, have shown promising results encompassing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in previous studies, supporting their implementation for COVID-19 vaccine development. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently authorized the emergency use of two RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. We review current gene-based vaccine candidates proceeding through clinical trials, including their antigenic targets, delivery vehicles, and route of administration. Important features of previous gene-based vaccine developments against other infectious diseases are discussed in guiding the design and development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and future derivatives.\n",

        "Background: With the absence of specific treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to control this infection is to quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and suspected or infected cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key findings: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases.\n",

        "Coronaviruses, seven of which are known to infect humans, can cause a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe illness and death. Four human coronaviruses (hCoVs)-229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43-circulate globally, commonly infect children and typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three novel coronaviruses of zoonotic origin have emerged during the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These novel coronaviruses are known to cause severe illness and death predominantly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Consistent with what has been observed during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or to have mild-to-moderate illness, with few deaths reported in children globally thus far. Clinical symptoms and laboratory and radiological abnormalities in children have been similar to those reported in adults but are generally less severe. A rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which has resulted in critical illness and some deaths has recently been described. Clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccine development should include paediatric considerations. Children may play an important role in the transmission of infection and outbreak dynamics and could be a key target population for effective measures to control outbreaks. The unintended consequences of the unprecedented scale and duration of pandemic control measures for children and families around the world should be carefully examined.Abbreviations: 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; ADEM, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics; ACE-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BCG, bacillus Calmette-Guérin; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CRP, C-reactive protein; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; CXR, chest X-ray; DOL, day of life; hCoV, human coronavirus; ICU, intensive care unit; IL, interleukin; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; KD, Kawasaki disease; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MEURI, monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions; MIS-C, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PICU, paediatric intensive care unit; RNA, ribonucleic acid; RCT, randomised-controlled trial; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TNF-alpha, tumour necrosis factor alpha; UK United Kingdom; UNICEF, United Nations Children's Fund; USA, United States of America; WHO, World Health Organization.\n",

This study aims to examine the relationship between social distancing measures and purchase intentions in the UK's restaurant and hotel sectors using a propensity score weighting experimental design method. The findings suggest that the impact of social distancing measures on purchase intentions is mediated by the trust in the targeted restaurant and hotel. Risk tolerance significantly moderates the influence of social distancing measures on trust; (non-) cash promotions have an insignificant impact on purchase intentions.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of 29 October 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths.\n",

Except for one patient who was diagnosed with mucormycosis concurrently with COVID-19, all patients received systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19. The mean duration between diagnosis of COVID-19 and development of symptoms of mucor was 15.6 ± 9.6 (3-42) days.

        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally as a severe pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates antigen-specific antibody responses. Multiple serologic tests have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. However, which antigens are most suitable for serological testing remains poorly understood. Specifically, which antigens have the highest sensitivity and specificity for serological testing and which have the least cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses are currently unknown. Previous studies have shown that the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein has very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the S2 domain of the S protein and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) show low-level cross-reactivity. Therefore, S1 is considered more specific than the native homotrimer of the S protein, and the receptor-binding domain as an antigen to test patient antibodies is more sensitive than the native N protein. In addition, an increasing number of studies have used multiantigen protein arrays to screen serum from convalescent patients with COVID-19. Antigen combinations demonstrated improved performance compared to each individual antigen. For rapid antigen detection, the sensitivity of the test is higher in the first week of onset of the disease with high viral loads. Highly sensitive and specific immunological diagnostic methods for antibodies or those that directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples would be beneficial for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

        "Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) instigated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more`` than 20 million people, with more than more than 700000 deaths globally; and has been declared a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as the seventh coronavirus affecting Homo sapiens. The symptoms of COVID-19 consist of an elevated temperature, cough, diarrhea, and vomiting amongst others, whereas the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to arise via release of respiratory secretions; through sneezing and coughing. COVID-19 is identified via X-ray or computed tomography scans and further corroborated with molecular diagnostics techniques, including polymerase chain reaction. At present there are no successful therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2; existing antiviral therapies have been utilized to hinder manifestation of respiratory difficulties by diminishing viral load. Herein, we depict an extensive update on the clinical aspects of COVID-19, including strategies for the regulation of the transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.Recently a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from South Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) named this mutant as a variant of concern - Omicron (B.1.1.529) on 26th November 2021. This variant exhibited more than thirty amino acid mutations in the spike protein. This mutation rate is exceeding the other variants by approximately 5-11 times in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant might have enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This new variant can reinfect individuals previously infected with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Scientists expressed their concern about the efficacy of already existing COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron (B.1.1.529) infections. Some of the crucial mutations that are detected in the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron variant have been shared by previously evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on the Omicron mutation profile in the receptor-binding domain and motif, it might have collectively enhanced or intermediary infectivity relative to its previous variants. Due to extensive mutations in the spike protein, the Omicron variant might evade the immunity in the vaccinated individuals.﻿Background: During the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, psychological problems like anxiety, depression, irritability, mood swings, inattention and sleep disturbance are fairly common among quarantined children in several studies.

The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings.The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement.The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment.

        "To accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection and its time-dependent progression, the rapid, sensitive, and noninvasive determination of immunoglobulins A specific to SARS-CoV-2 (IgA) in saliva and serum is needed to complement tests that detect immunoglobulins G and M. We have developed a dual optical/chemiluminescence format of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) immunosensor for IgA in serum and saliva. A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H2O2/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease. This IgA-LFIA immunosensor could be useful for noninvasively monitoring early immune responses to COVID-19 and for investigating the diagnostic/prognostic utility of salivary IgA in the context of large-scale screening to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n",

        "The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca, Regeneron mAb cocktail, Celltrion, and Rockefeller University. However, its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline's sotrovimab appear to be mild. Our work calls for new strategies to develop the next generation mutation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibodies.\n",

        "Introduction: Bacterial and fungal secondary infections following COVID-19 disease are widely being reported and are an area that should receive careful attention. Mucormycosis is a fatal fungal condition affecting immunocompromised patients caused by a group of mold mucoromycetes. Candida albicans (C. albicans) is an oral commensal present in almost 40-65% of healthy oral cavities in adults. Several cases of mucormycosis and oral candidiasis have been reported lately in COVID-19 patients, and it may elevate the associated risks of morbidity and mortality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Materials and methods: Articles were taken from a period of 2020 to April 2021 using search sources such as Cochrane, PubMed, Fungiscope and Mycobank using keywords mucormycosis, Black fungus, oral candidiasis, white fungus, COVID-19, Sars-Cov-2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Discussion: The development of oral mucocutaneous lesions, such as mucormycosis and candidiasis in COVID-19 patients could be due to inhaling spores resulting in pulmonary and/or sinus congestion and prolonged mechanical ventilation in the ICU settings and the long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics respectively. The onset of candidiasis after the emergence of COVID-19 clinical signs and symptoms varied considerably and is reported within 1-30 days in most of the cases reported in the literature. Biofilms present on the denture surfaces are predisposing factors to oral candidiasis. We aim to summarize the limited data available regarding diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic approaches for the management of Mucormycosis and oral candidiasis in COVID-19 patients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion: Careful monitoring of oral lesions should be instituted through interdisciplinary telemedicine and teleconsultation to aid in primary diagnosis, thereby avoiding personal attendance during the pandemic. Dental practitioners should be included among the interdisciplinary teams for exhaustive intraoral examination and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.\n",

        "Self-isolation and quarantine measures were introduced by the UK Government on 12 March 2020 as part of the 'delay' phase to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Non-adherence to self-isolation for 7 days after the development of symptoms is considered suboptimal and little is known about adherence to quarantine for 14 days if a co-habitant developed symptoms. This study aims to analyse non-adherence behaviours to self-isolation and quarantine measures by identifying their potential psycho-social and demographic predictors and by exploring people's accounts of their experiences with these measures. A mixed-methods convergent design was used, comprising an online survey (n = 681) completed by residents in six North London boroughs and qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants (n = 16). Findings identified not accessing community support, lack of control over leaving the house, and lack of perceived benefit and need to follow the rules as behaviours associated with non-adherence to quarantine (42.7%). Non-adherence to self-isolating measures (24.4%) was associated with individuals' perceived lack of control over responsibilities, lack of control over leaving the house, uncertainty about symptoms experienced, lack of access to tests, and distrust in the Government. Adherence to self-isolation and quarantine could be improved through strengthening perceived benefit to self-isolate with messages emphasising its effectiveness, by implementing a two-way information system to support symptoms identification, and with Government-funded, locally supported packages at different levels (financial, food, and practical needs).Initially, acute loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) was not considered important symptoms for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine the prevalence of these symptoms and to evaluate their diagnostic significance, we (approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association) prospectively collected data of cases of anosmia and ageusia from March 8, 2020, via telephone interview among 3,191 patients in Daegu, Korea. Acute anosmia or ageusia was observed in 15.3% (488/3,191) patients in the early stage of COVID-19 and in 15.7% (367/2,342) patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity. Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks. The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms. Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed an overwhelming burden on the healthcare system, and caused major disruption to the world economy. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that leads to a variety of symptoms in humans, including cough, fever and respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger extensive immune responses, including the production of antibodies. The detection of antibody response by serological testing provides a supplementary diagnostic tool to molecular tests. We hereby present a succinct yet comprehensive review on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as molecular mechanisms behind the strengths and limitations of serological antibody tests. The presence of antibodies can be detected in patient sera within days post symptom onset. Serological tests demonstrate superior sensitivity to molecular tests in some periods of time during disease development. Compared with the molecular tests, serological tests can be used for point-of-care testing, providing faster results at a lower cost. Commercially available serological tests show variable sensitivity and specificity, and the molecular basis of these variabilities are analysed. We discuss assays of different complexities that are used to specifically quantitate neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for vaccine development and herd immunity. Furthermore, we discuss examples of successful applications of serological tests to contact tracing and community-level sero-surveying, which provide invaluable information for pandemic management and assessment.The recent outbreak of CoVID-19 is declared as a global public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). A fresh figure of 2268011 positive cases and 155185 death records (till April 18th 2020) across the worldwide signify the severity of this viral infection. CoVID-19 infection is a pandemic, surface to surface communicable disease with a case fatality rate of 3.4% as estimated by WHO up to March 3rd 2020. Unfortunately, the current unavailability of an effective antiviral drug and approved vaccine, worsen the situation more critical. Implementation of an effective preventive measure is the only option left to counteract CoVID-19. Further, a retrospective analysis provides evidence that contemplates the decisive role of preventive measures in controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. A statistical surveillance report of WHO reflects, maintaining a coherent infection, prevention and control guideline resulted in a 30% reduction in healthcare-associated infections. The effectiveness of preventive measures completely relies on the strength of surface disinfectants, the composition of hand sanitizer, appropriate material for the manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE). This review enlightens the various preventive measures such as a suitable selection of surface disinfectants, appropriate hand sanitization, and empowering the PPE that could be a potential intervention to fight against CoVID-19.﻿Novel outbreak-associated food vehicles (i.e., foods not implicated in past outbreaks) can emerge as a result of evolving pathogens and changing consumption trends. To identify these foods, we examined data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System and found 14,216 reported outbreaks with information on implicated foods. We compared foods implicated in outbreaks during 2007-2016 with those implicated in outbreaks during 1973-2006. We identified 28 novel food vehicles, of which the most common types were fish, nuts, fruits, and vegetables; one third were imported. Compared with other outbreaks, those associated with novel food vehicles were more likely to involve illnesses in multiple states and food recalls and were larger in terms of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Two thirds of novel foods did not require cooking after purchase. Prevention efforts targeting novel foods cannot rely solely on consumer education but require industry preventive measures.\n",

COVID variants have appeared at regular intervals-alpha, beta, gamma, delta and now omicron. 'Omicron' is driving the current surge of cases in most countries including India and is poised to replace 'delta' the world over. This variant with more than 50 mutations is phylogenetically very different from other variants. The omicron variant spreads rapidly with an average doubling time of two days. The disease so far has been mild as compared with delta. Though previous infection and vaccination offer little or no protection against infection with omicron, they do seem to partially protect against hospitalization and severe disease. Booster vaccinations have not made any notable impact on the spread of omicron and have further worsened global vaccine equity. The indirect consequences of omicron from lockdowns, restrictions, travel bans, economic losses, health care worker infections and overwhelming of health care facilities are likely to be enormous. The direct effects of omicron on children are expected to be mild like with the previous variants. However, the indirect effects on child mental, physical, and social health may be considerable owing to school closures, missed vaccinations, neglect of other diseases, etc. It is, therefore, imperative that governments take rational decisions to navigate the world through this latest crisis.\n",
        "﻿Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019, it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the world. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others. There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic. This article reviews the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19, hoping it would be helpful for early prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide.\n",

        "Keywords: Asymptomatic infections; COVID-19; Epidemiological characteristic; Outcome; SARS-CoV-2.Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide as an Omicron variant. This variant is a heavily mutated virus and designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO cautioned that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 held a very high risk of infection, reigniting anxieties about the economy's recovery from the 2-year pandemic. The extensively mutated Omicron variant is likely to spread internationally, posing a high risk of infection surges with serious repercussions in some areas. According to preliminary data, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher risk of reinfection. On the other hand, whether the current COVID-19 vaccines could effectively resist the new strain is still under investigation. However, there is very limited information on the current situation of the Omicron variant, such as genomics, transmissibility, efficacy of vaccines, treatment, and management. This review focused on the genomics, transmission, and effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant, which will be helpful for further investigation of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2.\n",

        "﻿Post COVID-19, mucormycosis occurred after the SARS-CoV-2 has rampaged the human population and is a scorching problem among the pandemic globally, particularly among Asian countries. Invasive mucormycosis has been extensively reported from mild to severe COVID-19 survivors. The robust predisposing factor seems to be uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, comorbidity and immunosuppression acquired through steroid therapy. The prime susceptive reason for the increase of mucormycosis cases is elevated iron levels in the serum of the COVID survivors. A panoramic understanding of the infection has been elucidated based on clinical manifestation, genetic and non- genetic mechanisms of steroid drug administration, biochemical pathways and immune modulated receptor associations. This review lime-lights and addresses the \"What\", \"Why\", \"How\" and \"When\" about the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) in a comprehensive manner with a pure intention to bring about awareness to the common public as the cases are inevitably and exponentially increasing in India and global countries as well.

The web-based questionnaire was disseminated online from 1 to 31 October 2020. Out of 2117 respondents, 1405 (66.4%) knew that transmission of COVID-19 virus could happen in asymptomatic people. In term of antibiotics knowledge, 779 (36.8%) respondents were aware that taking antibiotics could not speed up the recovery process of all infections. Less than half of the respondents (49.0%) knew that antibiotics are effective against bacterial infection only. Majority (92.3%) practiced good preventive measures. Majority of the respondents strongly agreed that quarantine should be made mandatory for all arrival from overseas (97.2%) and wearing face masks should be made mandatory in all public areas (94.0%). Respondents of Chinese ethnicity (p = 0.008), middle-aged (p = 0.002), with tertiary education (p = 0.015) and healthcare related education (p < 0.001), from the higher income groups (p = 0.001) were more likely to have better knowledge on COVID-19. The Malaysian public demonstrated good knowledge towards COVID-19, adequate practice of preventive measures and high acceptance towards the new norm. Knowledge on antibiotics use and resistance was poor, which warrants attention from the health authorities.Azithromycin has rapidly been adopted as a repurposed drug for the treatment of COVID-19, despite the lack of high-quality evidence. In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase. Safety data warrant monitoring of drug-drug interactions and subsequent cardiac adverse events, especially with hydroxychloroquine. More prospective data of large randomised controlled studies are expected and much-needed. Uniform reporting of results should be strongly encouraged to facilitate data pooling with the many ongoing initiatives.Although clinical trials and real-world studies have affirmed the effectiveness and safety of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, reports of breakthrough infections and persistent emergence of new variants highlight the need to vigilantly monitor the effectiveness of these vaccines. Here we compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted.Pre-existing heart failure (HF) in diagnosed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a close to two-fold increased mortality rate compared to COVID-19 patients without prior HF history. Moreover, based both on biomarker as well as imaging findings, widespread endothelial and cardiac injury seems to be present in many patients presenting with COVID-19, associated with adverse outcomes including new onset HF. Systematic echocardiographic studies in patients with COVID-19 indicate that the most common cardiac pathology is right ventricular (RV) dilatation (39%) over and above both left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). In addition, myocardial injury, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is observed in some 55% to 70% of patients recently recovered from COVID-19 even in those who didn't get very sick during the acute illness. These observations seem to indicate a potentially rather high risk of clinical HF emerging in patients post-COVID-19, warranting close long-term monitoring of patients during recovery. On the other hand, given the established adverse prognostic role that pre-existing HF plays as a comorbidity in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, it not only seems important in the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that all patients with known HF should proactively be well controlled and treated according to current guidelines, but also additionally be considered for priority vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection if not yet vaccinated.\n",

Considering this, the rapid screening and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV) play an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, which can minimize local transmission and prevent an epidemic. Due to this public health emergency, the development of ultra-fast reliable diagnostic kits is essential for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

        "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). This disease was detected in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. People infected with COVID-19 shows varying manifestations, depending on their health and age. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, odynophagia, and dyspnea. Infected adults older 60 years of age are the group of patients most susceptible to severe COVID-19 states and present comor-bidity in the presence of chronic diseases. On the other hand, it is also essential to have tests to detect SARS-COV-2 in people and follow the evolution of COVID-19 quickly, reliably, and cheap. To achieve this, there are real-time reverse transcription pol-ymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, and enzyme immunostimulation. Currently, there are no drug treatments to prevent infection and to combat the virus's effects. However, different research groups that are conduct-ing in vitro, in vivo, and in silico tests to find drugs able to provide an immune response and to control infection in humans with SARS-CoV-2.

For all estimates, data from a meta-analysis was used to set the incubation period at a median of 5 days. The infectious period duration was maintained at 10 days, and peak infectiousness varied between 3 and 7 days (-2 and +2 days relative to the median incubation period). The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was varied between 0% and 70% to assess a wide range of possible proportions.\n",

        "Results: The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms.\n",

        "\n",
        "Conclusions and relevance: In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used.Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.﻿Gaussian distributions have been commonly assumed when clustering functional data. When the normality condition fails, biased results will follow. Additional challenges occur as the number of the clusters is often unknown a priori. This paper focuses on clustering non-Gaussian functional data without the prior information of the number of clusters. We introduce a semiparametric mixed normal transformation model to accommodate non-Gaussian functional data, and propose a penalized approach to simultaneously estimate the parameters, transformation function, and the number of clusters. The estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The practical utility of the methods is confirmed via simulations as well as an application of the analysis of Alzheimer's disease study. The proposed method yields much less classification error than the existing methods. Data used in preparation of this paper were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.\n",

Universal masking is recommended as a means of source control. Routinely exercising in a safe environment is an important strategy for healthy living during this crisis. As sports clubs and public spaces may serve a source of viral transmission, masking may become an integral part of physical activity. This study aimed to assess the physiological effects of wearing surgical masks and N95 respirators during short-term strenuous workout. This was a multiple cross-over trial of healthy volunteers. Using a standard cycle ergometry ramp protocol, each subject performed a maximal exercise test without a mask, with a surgical mask, and with an N95 respirator. Physiological parameters and time to exhaustion were compared. Each subject served his own control. Sixteen male volunteers (mean age and BMI of 34 ± 4 years and 28.72 ± 3.78 kg/m2 , respectively) completed the protocol. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and time to exhaustion did not differ significantly. Exercising with N95 mask was associated with a significant increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2 ) levels. The differences were more prominent as the load increased, reaching 8 mm Hg at exhaustion (none vs N95, P = .001). In conclusion, in healthy subjects, short-term moderate-strenuous aerobic physical activity with a mask is feasible, safe, and associated with only minor changes in physiological parameters, particularly a mild increase in EtCO2 . Subjects suffering from lung diseases should have a cautious evaluation before attempting physical activity with any mask.\n",

        "Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; face masks; personal distancing; physical activity; sport.In December 2019, a new variant coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China, which was initially described as a pneumonia of an unknown agent. The new coronavirus spreads mainly by person-to-person transmission through close contact. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is related to a complex immune system response that varies between people and, in severe cases of the disease, is characterized by excessive responses called \"cytokine storms,\" which are associated with complications that can lead to a state of hypercoagulation and death. Glucocorticoids and azithromycin are drugs that may be effective in the treatment. This review aims to highlight the clinical findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid and azithromycin therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. To date, many drugs have been studied for use in combination therapy, and the rapid expansion of knowledge about the virology of SARS-CoV-2 generates a more accurate direction in therapy.Since its first report in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly emerged as a pandemic affecting nearly all countries worldwide. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the need to identify genetic risk factors for susceptibility to this serious illness has emerged. Host genetic factors, along with other risk factors may help determine susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. It is hypothesized that the ACE2 gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a genetic risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and is required by the virus to enter cells. Together with ACE2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) also play an important role in disease severity. Evaluating the role of genetic variants in determining the direction of respiratory infections will help identify potential drug target candidates for further study in COVID-19 patients. We have summarized the latest reports demonstrating that ACE2 variants, their expression, and epigenetic factors may influence an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease outcome.﻿COVID-19 outbreak has a profound impact on almost every aspect of life.

Though methods of its detection are being continuously developed for the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19, still there is need for more novel methods. The presently used methods include rapid antigen tests, serological surveys, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), artificial intelligence-based techniques, and assays based on sensors/biosensors. Of all these, RT-PCR test has high sensitivity and specificity though it requires more time for testing and need for skilled technicians. Recently, electrochemical sensors have been developed for rapid monitoring and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from the patient's biological fluid samples. This review covers the recently developed electrochemical sensors that are focused on the detection of viral nucleic acid, immunoglobulin, antigen, and the entire viral particles. In addition, we also compare and assess their detection limits, sensitivities and specificities for the identification and monitoring of COVID-19. Furthermore, this review will address the best practices for the development of electrochemical sensors such as electrode fouling, limit of detection/limit of quantification determination and verification.\n",

        "Objectives: In order to reduce the costs and meet the expanding demands in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, complementary assays, such as rapid antigen tests, have been developed. Rigorous analysis under varying conditions is required to assess the clinical performance of these tests and to ensure reproducible results.\n",

Of 32 rRT-PCR positive samples, 19 demonstrated infectivity in cell culture, and 84 % of these samples were reactive with the antigen test. Seven full-genome sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates and SARS-CoV-1 were detected with this antigen test, with no cross-reactivity against other common respiratory viruses.\n",

        "Conclusions: Numerous antigen tests are available for SARS-CoV-2 testing and their performance to detect infectious individuals may vary. Head-to-head comparison along with cell culture testing for infectivity may prove useful to identify better performing antigen tests. The antigen test analyzed in this study is easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scalable. It can be helpful in monitoring infection trends and thus has potential to reduce transmission.\n",

        "During the December of 2019, a series of patients with pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus; the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona (COV-2), that is, COVID-19. Since the first cluster of cases was reported in China on 31 December 2019 until the 28 April 2020, there were internationally reported 3'000'000 cases, in over 185 countries, and 207'265 deaths. To date, it is still not unanimously clear which effects parameters of virus and host are important for the development of severe disease course. According to the most updated internationally available online cases register, COVID-19 disease has mild symptoms in around 85% of cases, there are 3%-10% of critical cases, and mortality is around 5%-7%. Since currently there is no available vaccine and no well-established specific antiviral therapy, numerous agents are being tested in clinical scenarios. The most common regimens include remdesivir, convalescent plasma. Widely used chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combinations, as well as lopinavir-ritonavir were shown to have less efficient treatment effects. More severe cases of pneumonia and dyspnoea, or uncontrollable fever are treated as inpatients, and nearly 10% in intensive care units. Oxygen supplementation is indicated to maintain peripheral blood oxygenation over 90%-96%. Advanced support systems include mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membranous support; however, those without targeted antiviral therapy represent only temporary bridge for scarce potential restitution in patient themselves. The aim of review is to present current state of the art in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical course and treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n",

        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought about a great threat to global public health. Recently, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant B.1.1.529 has been reported in South Africa and induced a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases. On November 24, 2021, B.1.1.529 named Omicron was designated as a variant under monitoring (VUM) by World Health Organization (WHO). Two days later, the Omicron variant was classified as a variant of concern (VOC). This variant harbors a high number of mutations, including 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike. The Omicron variant also shares several mutations with the previous VOC Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants, which immediately raised global concerns about viral transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immune evasion. Here we described the discovery and characteristics of the Omicron variant, compared the mutations of the spike in the five VOCs, and further raised possible strategies to prevent and overcome the prevalence of the Omicron variant.The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly around the world. Two types of approaches have been applied to use of face masks as a tool to prevent the spread this disease in society. The aim of the systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of face masks against the novel coronavirus. A literature search was performed using different databases until April 30, 2020. Search terms were ‘facemasks’, ‘novel coronavirus’, and ‘healthcare workers’. Five studies were included in the systematic review. A study stated that no difference between surgical and cotton masks. Also, two studies have emphasized the use of surgical masks or N95 respirators by medical staff, and two other studies emphasized the use of any type of face mask by general public. More studies in controlled contexts and studies of infections in healthcare and community places are needed for better definition of the effectiveness of face masks in preventing coronavirus.\n",
