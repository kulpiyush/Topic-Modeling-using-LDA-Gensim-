Topic Modeling LDA Gensim Overview:

   This project involves the development of a Question-Answering (QA) model tailored for biomedical text summarization in the context of COVID-19. 
   The model is designed to extract relevant information from biomedical literature using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework.

1. Features

  Implements PICO-based question formulation to enhance structured information retrieval.
  Utilizes NLP techniques for text pre-processing and analysis of biomedical literature.
  Trains on a curated dataset of COVID-19 biomedical articles and associated questions.
  Incorporates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling for exploratory literature review.
  Extracts structured insights from vast biomedical texts related to COVID-19.
  
3. Technologies Used:

   Natural Language Processing (NLP): SpaCy, NLTK
   Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, LDA topic modeling
   Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
   Text Analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
   Programming Language: Python

4. Dataset & Preprocessing

   The dataset consists of:
       Biomedical articles related to COVID-19.
       Structured questions based on the PICO framework:
            Population (P) - The group of people affected by COVID-19.
            Intervention (I) - The treatment, medication, or medical procedure.
            Comparison (C) - Alternative treatments or control groups.
            Outcome (O) - The result of the intervention.

5. Preprocessing Steps:
       Text cleaning and tokenization using NLP libraries.
       Stopword removal and lemmatization.
       Named entity recognition (NER) for biomedical terms.
       Feature extraction for model training.

6. Model Development:
   
   The QA model is trained using a combination of:
         Supervised learning for question-answer mapping.
         Unsupervised learning via LDA topic modeling to discover latent themes in biomedical literature.
   Evaluation conducted using standard NLP metrics.

7. Results:
    Successfully extracts key insights from biomedical literature.
    Effectively structures QA pairs using the PICO framework.
    Provides topic-wise exploration of COVID-19 research through LDA topic modeling.
